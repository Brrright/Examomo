The main objective of this system is to provide an online examination platform that ensures the honesty of students’ work while providing the necessary functions to conduct examinations and sufficient quality-of-life features for the students. We hope to provide a secure and reliable platform that brings reassurance to students who are using our online examination system. This will also ensure that students would not think of online examinations as a hassle but rather a convenience. On top of that, we also hope to create a platform that can lessen a lecturer’s burden by implementing easy-to-use and convenient tools when it comes to evaluating students’ examinations.
